# MonoPong
MonoPong: A Minimalistic Pong in Unity Engine
MonoPong is a minimalistic Pong-style game implemented in a single Unity game object using only a RawImage component. The game is designed to be visually appealing and can be used as a decorative or background element, or as a loading screen element. One of the main features of this project is that it does not require any additional graphic files or objects.


# How to Use
To use MonoPong, simply add the provided MonoPong.cs script to a GameObject with a RawImage component in your Unity project.


# Features
No additional graphic files or objects needed.
Automatically plays an infinite Pong-style game.
Minimalistic and visually appealing design.
Can be used as a decorative element or as part of a loading screen.
Implemented in a single GameObject with a RawImage component.


#How It Works
The MonoPong script defines a minimalistic Pong-style game using only a RawImage component. The game automatically plays, with the paddles and ball moving on their own. When the ball hits a paddle, sparks appear, adding a visual effect. The ball also leaves a trail, creating a smooth motion effect.
